Changes from PyDispatcher to Louie 1.0
======================================


Packaging and Distribution
--------------------------

- Louie uses setuptools_ for managing its placement in the Python
  package hierarchy.

.. _setuptools: http://www.python.org/pypi/setuptools


Naming and Importing
--------------------

- The package name for Louie is `louie`.

- The preferred way of using Louie is to only import the `louie`
  package, e.g.::

    import louie
    louie.connect(...)
    louie.send(...)

- Function and method names are lowercase_with_underscores, to conform
  to PEP-0008.


Plug-ins
--------

* Louie provides globally-registered plug-ins that augment various
  aspects of Louie's operation.

* Available plug-ins include the following:

  - `QtWidgetPlugin` knows how to handle Qt widgets that still exist
    as Python objects, but whose C++ objects have been destroyed.

  - `TwistedDispatchPlugin` converts Louie's default synchronous
    signal dispatching behavior to an asynchronous behavior based on
    Twisted Deferred objects.
